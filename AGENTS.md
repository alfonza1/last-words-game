# Repository Working Agreement

## Report the active branch

- Begin every user-facing progress update and final response with
  `Branch: <branch-name>.`
- Check the current branch before reporting it, and check again after any operation
  that may change `HEAD`.
- If `HEAD` is detached, report the short commit SHA instead.

## Commit frequently

Treat this as standing authorization to create local Git commits while implementing
requested changes in this repository.

- Commit after each coherent, working increment: a feature slice, bug fix, refactor,
  test addition, or meaningful documentation/configuration change.
- For larger tasks, prefer several small logical commits over one final bulk commit.
- Before committing, review `git status` and the relevant diff, then run targeted
  validation appropriate to the change.
- Stage explicit paths. Never include unrelated or pre-existing user changes.
- Use concise, scoped commit messages consistent with the repository history, such as
  `client: add wave speed scaling` or `server: reject duplicate usernames`.
- Do not commit secrets, generated outputs, dependency directories, or knowingly
  broken code unless the user explicitly requests a checkpoint commit.
- Do not commit directly to `main`; create or use a feature branch.
- Do not push commits or open a pull request unless the user explicitly asks.

## Think about edge cases and trade-offs

Don't just build the happy path. Surface the implications a change creates, even when
the user didn't ask — then proceed with a sensible default rather than blocking.

- Call out second-order effects: balance/fairness (e.g. a mobile-only speed change
  giving solver runs an edge on a shared leaderboard), security, performance, cost,
  data migration, and backwards compatibility.
- Expose the tuning knobs: when behavior hinges on a constant or threshold, name it,
  keep it in one place, and tell the user how to adjust it.
- Consider the boundaries: empty/zero/overflow inputs, first/last item, offline and
  signed-out states, mobile vs desktop, and concurrent or repeated actions.
- State the trade-off and your assumption so the user can course-correct.

## Follow Clean Code best practices

Write code in the spirit of Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin's *Clean Code*.

- Intention-revealing names; no magic numbers — name the constant.
- Small functions that do one thing at a single level of abstraction.
- Prefer self-explanatory code over comments; when you do comment, explain the *why*,
  not the *what*.
- DRY — extract real duplication, but don't over-abstract before a second use exists.
- Keep side effects obvious and localized; functions should hold no surprises.
- Leave each file cleaner than you found it (the Boy Scout Rule), matching the
  surrounding style.
